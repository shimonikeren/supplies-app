* This is an office supply order form app. It lets users input the names of items they need to purchase. 
* Whenever a user submits a item's name, the app will display the item on the left side of the page -- waiting to be purchased. 
* Each item in the waiting area also has a purchased button. When the user clicks it, the item will move to the right side of the page and appear in the 'Recently Purchased' section.
* Your app will store every item in a database, whether purchased or not.
